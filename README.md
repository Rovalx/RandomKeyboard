If only you are a developer or a tester you have encounterd a text field where you had to place some dummy data and you typed something like "asdasd asd bla bla bla", am I right?
Well, it may not be the reason to cry but let's say we want our app to look good from the very beginning or this data is saved in a database (a houndreds of "asd" messages!)

This is where this simple project can help you. Just clone the repo and install it on you device, it will deliver a new kaeboard that you can access from your Settings.

From now on you have access for this additional Keyboard:

Text are divided into 4 categories:
* long texts - More then casual one line of text
* short texts - Around 3 - 6 words in one sentance
* emoji text - simple, short text with lot of emojis, sometimes hashtags are included
* simple word - generates one, random word

## What can you do?

* You can customize and add new texts - just locate Texts.plist file in project files and edit it as you wish
* ... whatever you want. If you find something to improve - pull request or e-mail me.
