		<string>There are certain text input objects that your custom keyboard is not eligible to type into: secure fields (aka. passwords), phone pad objects (like the phone number fields in Contacts).</string>

		<string>If you&apos;re trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks. I&apos;ve had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don&apos;t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don&apos;t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.</string>
		<string>To me, the extraordinary aspect of martial arts lies in its simplicity. The easy way is also the right way, and martial arts is nothing at all special; the closer to the true way of martial arts, the less wastage of expression there is. </string>
		<string>I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.</string>
		<string>Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces, which our senses determine by its position to bodies, and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space.</string>
		<string>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven&apos;t found it yet, keep looking. Don&apos;t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you&apos;ll know when you find it.</string>
		<string>I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. &apos;Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death.</string>
		<string>The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.</string>
		<string>Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important.</string>

		<string>Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you. Let others leave their future in someone else’s hands, but not you.</string>
		<string>Trust yourself, then you will know how to live.</string>
		<string>You can never cross the ocean unless you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.</string>
		<string>When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has opened for us.</string>
		<string>Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.</string>
		<string>It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.</string>
		<string>I’m not afraid... I was BORN for this!</string>
		<string>Whatever you are willing to put up with is exactly what you will have.</string>
		<string>We are what we imagine. Our very existence consists in our imagination of ourselves. The greatest tragedy that can befall us is to go unimagined.</string>
		<string>There is a fire inside. Sit down beside it. Watch the flames, the ancient, flickering dance of yourself.</string>
		<string>Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.</string>
		<string>I have always known that at last I would take this road, but yesterday I did not know that it would be today.</string>
		<string>There is no chance, no destiny, no fate that can circumvent or hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul.</string>
		<string>Life is not discovery of fate; it is continuous creation of future, through choices of thoughts, feelings and actions in the present.</string>
		<string>You were born an original. Don’t die a copy.</string>
		<string>Is life not a hundred times too short for us to stifle ourselves?</string>
		<string>There is only one real failure in life that is possible, and that is not to be true to the best one knows.</string>
		<string>The pen that writes your life story must be held in your own hand.</string>
		<string>Every choice before you represents the universe inviting you to remember who you are and what you want.</string>
		<string>Men weary as much of not doing the things they want to do as of doing the things they do not want to do.</string>
		<string>Out of clutter, find simplicity. From discord, find harmony. In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.</string>
		<string>Nothing truly valuable arises from ambition or from a mere sense of duty; it stems rather from love and devotion towards men and towards objective things.</string>
		<string>To serve is beautiful, but only if it is done with joy and a whole heart.</string>
		<string>How do we keep our inner fire alive? Two things, at minimum, are needed: an ability to appreciate the positives in our life - and a commitment to action.</string>
		<string>Let him who would enjoy a good future waste none of his present.</string>
		<string>The path to our destination is not always a straight one. We go down the wrong road, we get lost, we turn back. Maybe it doesn’t matter which road we embark on. Maybe what matters is that we embark.</string>
		<string>It takes great courage to faithfully follow what we know to be true.</string>
		<string>Our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.</string>
		<string>Great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind, but great actions speak to all Mankind.</string>
		<string>There is a criterion by which you can judge whether the thoughts you are thinking and the things you are doing are right for you. The criterion is: Have they brought you inner peace?</string>
		<string>There is more in us than we know. If we can be made to see it, perhaps, for the rest of our lives, we will be unwilling to settle for less.</string>
		<string>From long familiarity, we know what honor is. It is what enables the individual to do right in the face of complacency and cowardice. It is what enables the soldier to die alone, the political prisoner to resist, the singer to sing her song, hardly appreciated, on a side street.</string>
		<string>We all live under the same sky, but we don’t all have the same horizon.</string>
		<string>If it doesn’t feel right, don’t do it. That is the lesson, and that lesson alone will save you a lot of grief.</string>
		<string>The time is always right to do what is right.</string>
		<string>Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.</string>
		<string>The goal of childhood is to become an individual; the goal of adulthood is to give that individuality away. The task of childhood is to separate; the task of adulthood is to connect.</string>
		<string>The best career advice to give the young is, find out what you like doing best and get someone else to pay you for doing it.</string>
		<string>The gem cannot be polished without friction nor man without trials.</string>
		<string>Hands that serve are holier than lips that pray.</string>
		<string>To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.</string>
		<string>You will recognize your own path when you come upon it, because you will suddenly have all the energy and imagination you will ever need.</string>
		<string>Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.</string>
		<string>The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.</string>
		<string>The height of your accomplishments will equal the depth of your convictions.</string>
		<string>I think the purpose of life is to be useful, to be responsible, to be honorable, to be compassionate. It is, after all, to matter: to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at all.</string>
		<string>Toil and risk are the price of glory, but it is a lovely thing to live with courage and die leaving an everlasting fame.</string>
		<string>To give real service you must add something which cannot be bought or measured with money, and that is sincerity and integrity.</string>
		<string>Dignity and respect has to do with ... your personal power to make a difference by being true to the best within you and letting that truth shine through your words and actions.</string>
		<string>When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bonds: Your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction, and you find yourself in a new, great, and wonderful world.    Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive, and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamed yourself to be.</string>
		<string>You will recognize your own path when you come upon it, because you will suddenly have all the energy and imagination you will ever need.</string>
		<string>Seek out that particular mental attribute which makes you feel most deeply and vitally alive, along with which comes the inner voice which says, ‘This is the real me,’ and when you have found that attitude, follow it.</string>
		<string>When you see what you’re here for, the world begins to mirror your purpose in a magical way. It’s almost as if you suddenly find yourself on a stage in a play that was written expressly for you.</string>
		<string>We seek purpose when we are not in touch with who we really are. When an apple tree discovers who it is, the question ‘what must I do?’ disappears. When you discover who you are (at the deepest place of your being) you will find your purpose.</string>
		<string>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life and don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. Most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.</string>
		<string>Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are.</string>
		<string>True happiness is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.</string>
		<string>When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bonds: Your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction, and you find yourself in a new, great, and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive, and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamed yourself to be.</string>

		<string>People who consider themselves victims of their circumstances will always remain victims unless they develop a greater vision for their lives.</string>
		<string>Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.</string>
		<string>I want to sing like the birds sing, not worrying about who hears or what they think.</string>
		<string>Love without action is meaningless and action without love is irrelevant.</string>
		<string>Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love.</string>
		<string>Having a vision for your life allows you to live out of hope, rather than out of your fears.</string>
		<string>To understand the heart and mind of a person, look not at what he has already achieved, but at what he aspires to do.</string>
		<string>I don’t know what your destiny will be, but one thing I know: the only ones among you who will be truly happy are those who have sought and found how to serve.</string>
		<string>If you want to know the past, to know what has caused you, look at yourself in the PRESENT, for that is the past’s effect. If you want to know your future, then look at yourself in the PRESENT, for that is the cause of the future.</string>
		<string>All of life is a near-death experience.</string>
		<string>When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, the world cries and you rejoice.</string>
		<string>There is a time to let things happen, and a time to make things happen.</string>
		<string>Life is what happens when you are making other plans.</string>
		<string>Circumstance does not make the man. Circumstance reveals man to himself.</string>
		<string>Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity.</string>
		<string>Truly loving another means letting go of all expectations. It means full acceptance, even celebration of another’s personhood.</string>
		<string>It is not how much we do, but how much love we put in the doing. It is not how much we give, but how much love we put in the giving.</string>
		<string>People take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness. Just because they’re not on your road doesn’t mean they’ve gotten lost.</string>
		<string>We look forward to the time when the Power of Love will replace the Love of Power. Then will our world know the blessings of Peace.</string>
		<string>We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.</string>
		<string>I’ve come to believe that each of us has a personal calling that’s as unique as a fingerprint - and that the best way to succeed is to discover what you love and then find a way to offer it to others in the form of service, working hard, and also allowing the energy of the universe to lead you.</string>
		<string>The purpose of life is not to fight against evil and misfortune; it is to unveil magnificence.</string>
		<string>A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are for.</string>
		<string>You often meet your destiny on the road you’ve taken to avoid it.</string>
		<string>Every positive change - every jump to a higher level of energy and awareness involves a rite of passage. Each time to ascend to a higher rung on the ladder of personal evolution, we must go through a period of discomfort, of initiation. I have never found an exception.</string>
		<string>There is a vitality, a life force, an energy that is translated through you; and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique.</string>
		<string>Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams, who looks inside awakes.</string>
		<string>Wisdom is knowing what path to take next... Integrity is taking it.</string>
		<string>We can’t change the wind, but we can adjust the sails.</string>
		<string>If you don’t design your own life plan, chances are you’ll fall into someone else’s plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.</string>
		<string>Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.</string>
		<string>The meaning of life is to give life meaning.</string>
		<string>Everyone has a purpose in life... a unique gift or special talent to give to others. And when we blend this unique talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of all goals.</string>
		<string>Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.</string>
		<string>It’s never too late to be what you might have been.</string>
		<string>Life’s like a movie; write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending...</string>
		<string>Life has meaning only if you do what is meaningful to you.</string>
		<string>Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.</string>
		<string>Life is a daring adventure or it is nothing at all.</string>
		<string>There is no security in this life. There is only opportunity.</string>
		<string>It may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work, and when we no longer know which way to go, we have begun our real journey.</string>
		<string>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.</string>
		<string>The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.</string>
		<string>Don’t ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.</string>
		<string>The only limits to the possibilities in your life tomorrow are the buts you use today.</string>
		<string>When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bounds. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive, and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamed yourself to be.</string>
		<string>Nothing happens unless first a dream.</string>
		<string>Strange is our situation here upon earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know - that man is here for the sake of other men.</string>
		<string>Man is not a being who stands still, he is a being in the process of becoming. The more he enables himself to become, the more he fulfills his true mission.</string>
		<string>The person without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder.</string>
		<string>Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.</string>
		<string>I think the purpose of life is to be useful, to be responsible, to be honorable, to be compassionate. It is, after all, to matter: to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at all.</string>
		<string>He who waits to do a great deal of good at once, will never do anything.</string>
		<string>You must be the change you wish to see in the world.</string>
		<string>A man is ethical only when life, as such, is sacred to him, that of plants and animals as that of his fellow men, and when he devotes himself helpfully to all life that is in need of help.</string>
		<string>It is never too late to become what you might have been.</string>
		<string>I had found a kind of serenity, a new maturity... I didn’t feel better or stronger than anyone else but it seemed no longer important whether everyone loved me or not — more important now was for me to love them. Feeling that way turns your whole life around; living becomes the act of giving.</string>
		<string>Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.</string>
		<string>A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.</string>
		<string>He who dares nothing need hope for nothing.</string>
		<string>Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs - even though checkered by failure - than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.</string>
		<string>A coward gets scared and quits. A hero gets scared, but still goes on.</string>
		<string>God is the mind that imagines physical reality. We are each like a cell in that mind.</string>
		<string>It’s never too late to change the programming imprinted in childhood, carried in our genes or derived from previous lives; the solution is mindfulness in the present moment.</string>
		<string>Talk to yourself in two languages - what do I fear and what do I love - in order to balance the body and the soul.</string>
		<string>Survival is for the human animal; fear the motivation. For the spiritual being survival is irrelevant. Curiosity, compassion and creativity are the name of the game; unconditional love the motivation.</string>
		<string>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres... And now these three remain: faith hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</string>
		<string>When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you’re the one smiling and everyone around you is crying.</string>
		<string>There will come a time when you believe everything is finished. That will be the beginning.</string>
		<string>Life is really simple, but men insist on making it complicated.</string>
		<string>Only through love can we obtain communion with God.</string>
		<string>The soul would have no rainbow if the eyes had no tears.</string>
		<string>Help me never to judge another until I have walked a mile in his moccasins.</string>
		<string>In the place of stillness, rises potential. From the place of potential, emerges possibility. Where there is possibility, there is choice. And where there is choice, there is freedom!</string>
		<string>All major religious traditions carry basically the same message, that is love, compassion and forgiveness ... the important thing is they should be part of our daily lives.</string>
		<string>You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.</string>
		<string>Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting.</string>
		<string>This above all; to your own self be true.</string>
		<string>I honor the place in you in which the entire universe dwells. I honor the place in you, which is of love, of truth, of light and of peace. When you are in that place in you, and I am in that place in me, we are one.</string>
		<string>To love yourself right now, just as you are, is to give yourself heaven. Don’t wait until you die. If you wait, you die now. If you love, you live now.</string>
		<string>Man is lost and is wandering in a jungle where real values have no meaning. Real values can have meaning to man only when he steps on to the spiritual path, a path where negative emotions have no use.</string>
		<string>The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and often political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you.</string>
		<string>When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy.</string>
		<string>The most common form of despair is not being who you are.</string>
		<string>To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.</string>
		<string>Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.</string>
		<string>Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it’s holy ground. There is no greater investment.</string>
		<string>God experiences Life through each of us, and we experience Life thanks to God.</string>
		<string>To speak gratitude is courteous and pleasant, but to live gratitude is to touch heaven.</string>
		<string>Just listen to the still voice within. This is the mind to trust. This is god consciousness speaking, not the ego that is seeking recognition.</string>
		<string>The first step toward change is acceptance. Once you accept yourself, you open the door to change.</string>
		<string>It is not the answer that enlightens, but the question.</string>
		<string>Choose being kind over being right, and you’ll be right every time.</string>
		<string>Insight occurs when, and to the degree that, one knows oneself.</string>
		<string>What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself.</string>
		<string>Knowing others is wisdom; knowing the self is enlightenment.</string>
		<string>You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.</string>
		<string>Our prayers are answered not when we are given what we ask, but when we are challenged to be what we can be.</string>
		<string>Each today, well-lived, makes yesterday a dream of happiness and each tomorrow a vision of hope. Look, therefore, to this one day, for it and it alone is life.</string>
		<string>The period of greatest gain in knowledge and experience is the most difficult period in one’s life.</string>
		<string>How do we nurture the soul? By revering our own life. By learning to love it all, not only the joys and the victories, but also the pain and the struggles.</string>
		<string>When there is love in your heart, everything outside of you also becomes lovable.</string>
		<string>You are free to believe what you choose and what you do attests to what you believe.</string>
		<string>When we focus on clarifying what is being observed, felt, and needed rather than on diagnosing and judging, we discover the depth of our own compassion.</string>
		<string>Only in quiet waters things mirror themselves undistorted. Only in a quiet mind is adequate perception of the world.</string>
		<string>All changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter another.</string>
		<string>The ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned.</string>
		<string>Every human has four endowments - self awareness, conscience, independent will and creative imagination. These give us the power to discern, to choose, to respond, to change.</string>
		<string>If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.</string>
		<string>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</string>
		<string>It is love alone that leads to right action. What brings order in the world is to love and let love do what it will.</string>
		<string>It is only by grounding our awareness in the living sensation of our bodies that the ‘I Am,’ our real presence, can awaken.</string>
		<string>Love gives us in a moment what we can hardly attain by effort after years of toil.</string>
		<string>This is the way of peace: Overcome evil with good, and falsehood with truth, and hatred with love.</string>
		<string>Some people, no matter how old they get, never lose their beauty - they merely move it from their faces into their hearts.</string>
		<string>Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul.</string>
		<string>Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don’t resist them, that only creates sorrow. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.</string>
		<string>The more conscious you become, the more aware you become of how unconscious you’ve been.</string>
		<string>The human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it.</string>
		<string>The more you recognize the immense good within you, the more you magnetize immense good around you.</string>
		<string>There is no difficulty that enough LOVE will not conquer, no disease that enough LOVE will not heal, no door that enough LOVE will not open, no gulf that enough LOVE will not bridge, no wall that enough LOVE will not throw down, no sin that enough LOVE will not redeem...</string>
		<string>Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.</string>
		<string>Love all God’s creations, both the whole and every grain of sand. Love every leaf, every ray of light. Love the animals, love the plants, love each separate thing. If you love each thing, you will perceive the mystery of God in All.</string>
		<string>Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here. The spiritual journey is the relinquishment, or unlearning, of fear and the acceptance of love back into our hearts.</string>
		<string>Meditation takes place when you bring all your awareness to this moment.</string>
		<string>Talk to yourself in two languages - what do I fear and what do I love - in order to balance the body and the soul.</string>
		<string>The eye through which I see God is the same eye through which God sees me; my eye and God’s eye are one eye, one seeing, one knowing, one love.</string>
		<string>Every positive change - every jump to a higher level of energy and awareness involves a rite of passage. Each time to ascend to a higher rung on the ladder of personal evolution, we must go through a period of discomfort, of initiation. I have never found an exception.</string>
		<string>The world we are experiencing today is the result of our collective consciousness, and if we want a new world, each of us must start taking responsibility for helping create it.</string>
		<string>Unity consciousness is a state of enlightenment where we pierce the mask of illusion which creates separation and fragmentation. Behind the appearance of separation is one unified field of wholeness. Here the seer and the scenery are one.</string>
		<string>Our inner guidance comes to us through our feelings and body wisdom first - not through intellectual understanding. The intellect works best in service to our intuition, our inner guidance, soul, God or higher power - whichever term we choose for the spiritual energy that animates life.</string>
		<string>If we fail to nourish our souls, they wither, and without soul, life ceases to have meaning.... The creative process shrivels in the absence of continual dialogue with the soul. And creativity is what makes life worth living.</string>
		<string>If you open your heart, love opens your mind.</string>
		<string>Love’s greatest gift is its ability to make everything it touches sacred.</string>
		<string>When we seek for connection, we restore the world to wholeness. Our seemingly separate lives become meaningful as we discover how truly necessary we are to each other.</string>
		<string>Love wholeheartedly, be surprised, give thanks and praise then you will discover the fullness of your life.</string>
		<string>Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.</string>
		<string>If you judge people, you have no time to love them.</string>
		<string>Any situation that you find yourself in, is an outward reflection of your inner state of beingness.</string>
		<string>There are no guarantees. From the viewpoint of fear, none are strong enough. From the viewpoint of love, none are necessary.</string>
		<string>Do not do tomorrow what you can do today. If you feel the need to forgive, forgive today. If you feel the need to risk, risk today. If you feel the need to apologize, apologize today. If you feel the need to love someone, love them today. If you feel the need to create something, create something today. If you do this there will be no conflict within, you will grow in Spirit because you will be your true authentic Self - living at full potential. Live today not for tomorrow.</string>
		<string>Love is the key. If we start to express the spring of love within that is our true essence, our Truth, our spark of Divinity... and allow it to flow more... then all is revealed. Love becomes our guide in life, our connection with All, and our path back to Source.</string>
		<string>The most profound choice in life is to either accept things as they exist or to accept the responsibility for changing them.</string>
		<string>Life simply is. It follows its course. Give yourself to the moment. Let life reveal itself to you.</string>
		<string>Love is how it feels to recognize our essential unity. Awakening to oneness is the experience of Big Love. Knowing you are one with all, you find yourself in love with all.</string>
		<string>We turn to God for help when our foundations are shaking, only to learn that it is God who is shaking them.</string>
		<string>If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough.</string>
		<string>If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul.</string>
		<string>The outer conditions of a person’s life will always be found to reflect their inner beliefs.</string>
		<string>Your perception is your reality.</string>
		<string>In our desire to impose form on the world and our lives we have lost the capacity to see the form that is already there; and in that lies not liberation but alienation, the cutting off from things as they really are.</string>
		<string>Light that is One though the lamps be many.</string>
		<string>I am grateful for life And all that I love I am grateful for the Earth And the Sun up above I am grateful for my spirit And my inner being For the One that I express And the joy of this feeling</string>
		<string>You think of yourselves as humans searching for a spiritual awakening, when in fact you are spiritual beings attempting to cope with a human awakening. Seeing yourselves from the perspective of the spirit within will help you to remember why you came here and what you came here to do.</string>
		<string>We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.</string>
		<string>I close my eyes in order to see.</string>
		<string>You are as old as God and as young as the morning.</string>
		<string>There is one river of Truth which receives tributaries from every side.</string>
		<string>The search for wisdom is a great challenge; to act on wisdom is an even greater challenge.</string>
		<string>The moment one gives close attention to any thing, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself.</string>
		<string>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace... Where there is hatred, let me sow love; Where there is injury, pardon; Where there is doubt, faith;    Where there is despair, hope; Where there is darkness, light; Where there is sadness, joy; O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; To be understood as to understand; To be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; It is in pardoning that we are pardoned; And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.</string>
		<string>We start, then, with nothing, pure zero. But this is not the nothing of negation. For ‘not’ means ‘other than,’ and other is merely a synonym of the ordinal numeral second. As such it implies a first; while the present pure zero is prior to every first. The nothing of negation is the nothing of death, which comes second to, or after, everything. But this pure zero is the nothing of not having been born. There is no individual thing, no compulsion, outward nor inward, no law. It is the germinal nothing, in which the whole universe is involved or foreshadowed. As such, it is absolutely undefined and unlimited possibility —boundless possibility. There is no compulsion and no law. It is boundless freedom.</string>
		<string>Love is unconditional acceptance. It is love of parents for child; also the nonpossessive love of partners; also the caring love between all people that enables forgiveness. It’s above energy, though it may be expressed energetically. It’s our essential nature: Spirit itself, the quality we share with God. And it is the binding force of the Universe, inherent in all that is.</string>
		<string>Of the Good in you I can speak, but not of the Evil. For what is Good, tortured by it’s own hunger and thirst? When Good is hungry, it seeks food, even in dark caves, and when it thirsts, it drinks even of dead waters.</string>
		<string>To err is human; to forgive, divine.</string>
		<string>Love... if you don’t have it, no matter what else you may have, it’s not enough.</string>
		<string>A person does not have to be behind bars to be a prisoner. People can be prisoners of their own concepts and ideas. They can be slaves to their own selves.</string>
		<string>The ultimate lesson all of us have to learn is unconditional love, which includes not only others but ourselves as well.</string>
		<string>All truly wise thoughts have been thought already thousands of times; but to make them truly ours, we must think them over again honestly, till they take root in our personal experience.</string>
		<string>When we feel passion for something, it is because we are remembering what it was that we came here to do. The more passion we feel, the more in alignment with Source we are, allowing this energy to pour through us with no hesitation. This is the way it was meant to be.</string>
		<string>We need a renaissance of wonder. We need to renew, in our hearts and in our souls, the deathless dream, the eternal poetry, the perennial sense that life is miracle and magic.</string>
		<string>What is not brought to consciousness, comes to us as fate.</string>
		<string>Go out looking for one thing, and that’s all you’ll ever find.</string>
		<string>Bring everything up to the surface. Accept your humanity, your animality. Whatsoever is there, accept it without any condemnation. Acceptance is transformation, because through acceptance awareness becomes possible.</string>
		<string>Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life.</string>
		<string>I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.</string>
		<string>To be alive, to be able to see, to walk... it’s all a miracle.</string>
		<string>True religion is the life we lead, not the creed we profess.</string>
		<string>Know that although in the eternal scheme of things you are small, you are also unique and irreplaceable, as are all your fellow humans everywhere in the world.</string>
		<string>I died from a mineral and plant became, Died from the plant, took a sentient frame; Died from the beast, donned a human dress When by my dying did I ever grow less...</string>
		<string>A holy person is someone who is whole; who has, as it were, reconciled his opposites.</string>
		<string>Only that day dawns to which we are awake.</string>
		<string>Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.</string>
		<string>At times of writing I never think what I have said before. My aim is not to be consistent with my previous statements on a given question, but to be consistent with truth as it may present itself to me at a given moment. The result has been that I have grown from truth to truth.</string>
		<string>Doing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing.</string>
		<string>He who binds to himself a Joy, Does the winged life destroy; He who kisses the Joy as it flies, Lives in Eternity’s sunrise.</string>
		<string>The door you open to give love is the very one through which love arrives.</string>
		<string>Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.</string>
		<string>Generosity is another quality which, like patience, letting go, non-judging, and trust, provides a solid foundation for mindfulness practice.</string>
		<string>Wise and strong is he who leaves his heart open and searches without fear.</string>
		<string>There are only four great questions in life: What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for? What is worth dying for? The answer to all of them is the same: Only Love.</string>
		<string>Those of us who have transcended mythical belief systems know without any doubt that there is no God up in the sky. But when we awaken to what I call the evolutionary impulse - the mysterious passion to evolve, to become, to develop on every level--we rediscover who God is.</string>
		<string>We don’t see things as they are. We see things as we are.</string>
		<string>Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.</string>
		<string>Only in quiet waters things mirror themselves undistorted. Only in a quiet mind is adequate perception of the world.</string>
		<string>Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here. The spiritual journey is the relinquishment, or unlearning, of fear and the acceptance of love back into our hearts.</string>
		<string>So many assume the truth is either black or white... It’s all evolution or it’s totally creation, for example. Reality creates consciousness; consciousness creates reality. Actually truth is inclusive, neither black nor white, nor a shade of grey. Indeed, truth is a multicolored spectrum, a beautiful hologram!</string>
		<string>The truth in you remains as radiant as a star, as pure as light, as innocent as love itself.</string>
		<string>Choose again. Pretend that you are enlightened. Pretend that you are loved by God. Pretend that you are perfect just the way you are. Take a deep breath now and PRETEND WHAT IS TRUE. Then everything will make sense. “When you pretend something that is true, then you immediately become that Truth. “First the energy of God descends upon the Earth, then it pretends whatever it wants to be, then it ascends back to its source. You are God pretending to be whatever you are right now. Do you understand what this means? You have allowed yourself to descend, but by pretending to be less than what you are, you have not ascended back to God.</string>
		<string>Love is much more fundamental than any kind of thinking or believing. It is the root and basis of who you are, at the most fundamental level. This means that anything other than love as an expression of your being is artificial and unnatural and is a result of not knowing who you are.</string>
		<string>Too Slow for those who Wait, Too Swift for those who Fear, Too Long for those who Grieve, Too Short for those who Rejoice, But for those who Love Time is not.</string>
		<string>We are more than what we do... much more than what we accomplish... far more than what we possess.</string>
		<string>Your thoughts are like the seeds you plant in your garden. Your beliefs are like the soil in which you plant these seeds.</string>
		<string>In the province of the mind, what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true.</string>
		<string>Don’t believe everything you think.</string>
		<string>Some things have to be believed to be seen.</string>
		<string>Don’t think you are, know you are!</string>
		<string>Perhaps the only limits to the human mind are those we believe in.</string>
		<string>We do not see things as they are. We see them as we are.</string>
		<string>If the only prayer you said in your whole life was, ‘thank you,’ that would suffice.</string>
		<string>There are two ways to slide easily through life: to believe everything or to doubt everything; both ways save us from thinking.</string>
		<string>What is needed is not the will to believe but the will to find out, which is the exact opposite.</string>
		<string>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen, nor touched... but are felt in the heart.</string>
		<string>Asking the proper questions is the central action of transformation. Questions are the key that causes the secret doors of the psyche to swing open.</string>
		<string>There’s no beauty that you could perceive or create if it were not already within you...</string>
		<string>What we see depends mainly on what we look for.</string>
		<string>Why is it that if someone tells you that there are 1 billion stars in the universe you will believe them but if they tell you a wall has wet paint you will have to touch it to be sure?</string>
		<string>Evil (ignorance) is like a shadow—it has no real substance of its own, it is simply a lack of light. You cannot cause a shadow to disappear by trying to fight it, stamp on it,    by railing against it, or any other form of emotional or physical resistance. In order to cause a shadow to disappear, you must shine light on it.</string>
		<string>If there is light in the soul, There will be beauty in the person. If there is beauty in the person, There will be harmony in the house. If there is harmony in the house, There will be order in the nation. If there is order in the nation, There will be peace in the world.</string>
		<string>What we think is less than what we know; What we know is less than what we love; What we love is so much less than what there is. And to that precise extent we are so much less than what we are.</string>
		<string>When we love, we are the universe and the universe lives in us.</string>
		<string>The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.</string>
		<string>You live in illusions and the appearance of things. There is a Reality, you are that Reality. When you recognize this you will realize you are nothing, and being nothing, you are everything. That is all.</string>
		<string>If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.</string>
		<string>Man has no body distinct from his soul; for that called body is a portion of soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of soul in this age.</string>
		<string>I sought my God and my God I could not find. I sought my soul and my soul eluded me. I sought my brother to serve him in his need, and I found all three—my God, my soul, and thee.</string>
		<string>Gratitude is the heart’s memory.</string>
		<string>My religion is simple, my religion is kindness.</string>
		<string>Faith is like a toothbrush. Every person should have one and use it regularly, but he shouldn’t try to use someone else’s.</string>
		<string>The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult and left untried.</string>
		<string>Do not dwell in the past, do not dwell in the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.</string>
		<string>What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.</string>
		<string>This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.</string>
		<string>We must never cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.</string>
		<string>To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation. This creates an endless preoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge the present moment and allow it to be. The compulsion arises because the past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both are illusions.</string>
		<string>Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible, it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could.</string>
		<string>My religion is simple, my religion is kindness.</string>
		<string>As human beings we all want to be happy and free from misery… we have learned that the key to happiness is inner peace. The greatest obstacles to inner peace are disturbing emotions such as anger, attachment, fear and suspicion, while love and compassion and a sense of universal responsibility are the sources of peace and happiness.</string>
		<string>God will become visible as God’s image is reborn in you.</string>
		<string>The Spirit is neither good nor bad, it runs where the wild heart leads</string>
		<string>Wisdom begins in wonder.</string>
		<string>To speak gratitude is courteous and pleasant, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live gratitude is to touch Heaven.</string>
		<string>We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy is when men are afraid of the light.</string>
		<string>The best way to know God is to love many things.</string>
		<string>Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands, but like the seafaring man on the desert of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them, you reach your destiny.</string>
		<string>Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity.</string>
		<string>The highest form of spiritual work is the realization of the essence of man.... You never learn the answer; you can only become the answer.</string>
		<string>Be grateful for whoever comes, because each guest has been sent as a guide from beyond</string>
		<string>Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.</string>
		<string>Be ready when opportunity comes.... Luck is when preparation and opportunity meet.</string>
		<string>Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.</string>
		<string>One important key to success is self-confidence. An important key to self-confidence is preparation.</string>
		<string>For myself I am an optimist - it does not seem to be much use being anything else.</string>
		<string>What a wonderful life I’ve had! I only wish I’d realized it sooner.</string>
		<string>Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance.</string>
		<string>What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.</string>
		<string>Let us rise up and be thankful, for Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.</string>
		<string>Both abundance and lack exist simultaneously in our lives, as parallel realities. It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will tend... when we choose to be grateful for the abundance that’s present -- love, health, family, friends, work, the joys of nature and personal pursuits that bring us pleasure -- the wasteland of lack falls away and we experience heaven on Earth.</string>
		<string>The height of your accomplishments is determined by the depth of your convictions.</string>
		<string>There are three kinds of people: those who let it happen, those who make it happen, and those who wonder what happened.</string>
		<string>It is not in everyone’s power to secure wealth, office, or honors; but everyone may be good, generous, and wise.</string>
		<string>If you’re never scared or embarrassed or hurt, it means you never take any chances.</string>
		<string>Being defeated is often only a temporary condition. Giving up is what makes it permanent.</string>
		<string>Some people say I have attitude - maybe I do. But I think you have to. You have to believe in yourself when no one else does - that makes you a winner right there.</string>
		<string>The tragedy of life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.</string>
		<string>Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another.</string>
		<string>View money and things not as something you create to fill a lack, but as tools to help you more fully express yourself and realize your potential.</string>
		<string>Abilities wither under faultfinding, blossom with encouragement.</string>
		<string>We have to do the best we can. This is our sacred human responsibility.</string>
		<string>When we feel stuck, going nowhere - even starting to slip backward - we may actually be backing up to get a running start.</string>
		<string>What is opportunity, and when does it knock? It never knocks. You can wait a whole lifetime, listening, hoping, and you will hear no knocking. None at all. You are opportunity, and you must knock on the door leading to your destiny.</string>
		<string>Learn to expect, not to doubt. In so doing, you bring everything into the realm of possibility.</string>
		<string>Go out looking for one thing, and that’s all you’ll ever find.</string>
		<string>Money is neither my god nor my devil. It is a form of energy that tends to make us more of who we already are, whether it’s greedy or loving.</string>
		<string>An investment in knowledge pays the best dividends.</string>
		<string>The journey of a thousand miles must begin with a small step.</string>
		<string>A wise man should have money in his head, but not in his heart.</string>
		<string>Integrity is the essence of everything successful.</string>
		<string>Money - like health, love, happiness, and all forms of success that you want to create for yourself - is the result of living purposefully. It is not a goal unto itself.</string>
		<string>The gratification of wealth is not found in mere possession or in lavish expenditure, but in its wise application.</string>
		<string>The real measure of your wealth is how much you’d be worth if you lost all your money.</string>
		<string>Entrepreneurship is a state of mind, a can-do attitude, a capacity to focus on a vision and work toward it.</string>
		<string>I believe life is a series of near misses. A lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all. It’s seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future. It’s seeing what other people don’t see and pursuing that vision.</string>
		<string>Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.</string>
		<string>Winners are losers who got up and gave it one more try.</string>
		<string>Either you deal with what is the reality or you can be sure that the reality is going to deal with you.</string>
		<string>Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.</string>
		<string>The greater danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.</string>
		<string>Life is not measured by its length, but by its depth.</string>
		<string>The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they can’t find them, they make them.</string>
		<string>There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it.</string>
		<string>I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.</string>
		<string>Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.</string>
		<string>A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of opportunities. An optimist makes opportunities of so-called difficulties.</string>
		<string>Ships are safe within the harbor, but is that what ships are for?</string>
		<string>Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is better than no action at all.</string>
		<string>Winners are the people who when the odds are stacked against them, and those around them have fallen, will have the courage to look within themselves and make the unbelieveable believeable, and the impossible possible.</string>
		<string>Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you. Let others leave their future in someone else’s hands, but not you.</string>
		<string>When you follow your bliss doors will open where you would not have thought there would be doors; and where there wouldn’t be a door for anyone else.</string>
		<string>Persistent people begin their success where others end in failure.</string>
		<string>Create a set of great personal values and surround yourself with the right people that can form your support system. Have an optimistic spirit and develop a strong purpose that you completely believe in and everything you can imagine is possible, for you.</string>
		<string>If you’re going through hell, keep going.</string>
		<string>Things that are impossible just take longer.</string>
		<string>The darkest hour has only sixty minutes.</string>
		<string>All I would tell people is to hold onto what was individual about themselves, not to allow their ambition for success to cause them to try to imitate the success of others. You’ve got to find it on your own terms.</string>
		<string>Money like health, love, happiness, and all forms of success that you want to create for yourself is the result of living purposefully. It is not a goal unto itself.</string>
		<string>We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.</string>
		<string>Good instincts usually tell you what to do long before your head has figured it out.</string>
		<string>Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.</string>
		<string>It is good to dream, but it is better to dream and work. Faith is mighty, but action with faith is mightier. Desiring is helpful, but work and desire are invincible.</string>
		<string>When the bull’s-eye becomes as big in your mind as an elephant, you are sure to hit it.</string>
		<string>Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.</string>
		<string>The minute you settle for less than you deserve, you get even less than you settled for.</string>
		<string>Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.</string>
		<string>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.</string>
		<string>The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials.</string>
		<string>The two things I did learn were that you are as powerful and strong as you allow yourself to be, and that the most difficult part of any endeavor is taking the first step, making the first decision.</string>
		<string>Whether you be man or woman, you will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor.</string>
		<string>Optimism is essential to achievement and it is also the foundation of courage and true progress.</string>
		<string>If successful people have one common trait, it’s an utter lack of cynicism. The world owes them nothing. They go out and find what they need without asking for permission; they’re driven, talented, and work through negatives by focusing on the positives.</string>
		<string>It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan.</string>
		<string>The wise man bridges the gap by laying out the path by means of which he can get from where he is to where he wants to go.</string>
		<string>To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.</string>
		<string>Trials, temptations, disappointments -- all these are helps instead of hindrances, if one uses them rightly. They not only test the fibre of a character, but strengthen it. Every conquered temptation represents a new fund of moral energy. Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before.</string>
		<string>If you have made mistakes there is always another chance for you... you may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down.</string>
		<string>Apathy can be overcome by enthusiasm, and enthusiasm can be aroused by two things: first, an idea which takes the imagination by storm; and second, a definite, intelligible plan for carrying that idea into action.</string>
		<string>Energy is the essence of life. Every day you decide how you’re going to use it by knowing what you want and what it takes to reach that goal, and by maintaining focus.</string>
		<string>You can’t help someone get up a hill without getting closer to the top yourself.</string>
		<string>Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.</string>
		<string>Action is where it’s at, as far as making dreams come true. We ourselves are the prime channel for our creations, so if we don’t act but just wait, then we are blocking the channel. If we do act then we will be supported by all that we are connected to... which is All That Is if we act with love and service as our motivation.</string>
		<string>You are your own most important resource for making your life work. Life rewards action. Until your knowledge, awareness, insights, and understandings are translated into action, they are of no value.</string>
		<string>Be thankful for what you have; you’ll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don’t have, you will never, ever have enough.</string>
		<string>You don’t get in life what you want. You get what you are.</string>
		<string>Nothing is more endangered in the modern world than the powerful combination of hard work toward meaningful goals joined with an exuberant embrace of the present moment.</string>
		<string>It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.</string>
		<string>All problems become smaller if you don’t dodge them, but confront them.</string>
		<string>Life is mostly froth and bubble. Two things stand like stone: kindness in another’s trouble, courage in our own.</string>
		<string>That which does not kill you makes you stronger.</string>
		<string>It’s easy to be brave from a safe distance.</string>
		<string>It’s not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it’s because we do not dare that they are difficult.</string>
		<string>Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.</string>
		<string>The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty.</string>
		<string>Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterward.</string>
		<string>Experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.</string>
		<string>Only those who do nothing at all make no mistakes... but that would be a mistake.</string>
		<string>Life is a leap into the unknown. If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.</string>
		<string>Be master of your petty annoyances and conserve your energies for the big, worthwhile things. It isn’t the mountain ahead that wears you out - it’s the grain of sand in your shoe.</string>
		<string>Destiny is as destiny does. If you believe you have no control, then you have no control.</string>
		<string>Vision without action is a daydream; action without vision is a nightmare.</string>
		<string>Persistence. Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan, ‘Press on,’ has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.</string>
		<string>Courage is the mastery of fear, not the absence of fear.</string>
		<string>Be like a postage stamp. Stick to one thing until you get there.</string>
		<string>I couldn’t wait for success....so I went ahead without it.</string>
		<string>If you can find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn’t lead anywhere.</string>
		<string>If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way; if you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.</string>
		<string>He who dares nothing need hope for nothing.</string>
		<string>Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs - even though checkered by failure - than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.</string>
		<string>A coward gets scared and quits. A hero gets scared, but still goes on.</string>
		<string>Healing comes from taking responsibility: to realize that it is you - and no one else that creates your thoughts, your feelings, and your actions.</string>
		<string>Life is a journey and if you fall in love with the journey you will be in love forever.</string>
		<string>When you return to your old hometown, you find it wasn’t the town you missed, but your childhood.</string>
		<string>As we grow old, the beauty steals inward.</string>
		<string>Life begins as a quest of the child for the man, and ends as a journey by the man to rediscover the child.</string>
		<string>Ultimately your greatest teacher is to live with an open heart.</string>
		<string>Doing what you like is freedom. Liking what you do is happiness.</string>
		<string>We forge the chains we wear in life.</string>
		<string>If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never be fulfilled. If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the world belongs to you.</string>
		<string>Everything is a gift of the universe—even joy, anger, jealously, frustration, or separateness. Everything is perfect either for our growth or our enjoyment.</string>
		<string>There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its hands. You seek problems because you need their gifts.</string>
		<string>If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes.</string>
		<string>Tension is who you think you should be, relaxation is who you are.</string>
		<string>I believe the recipe for happiness to be just enough money to pay the monthly bills you acquire, a little surplus to give you confidence, a little too much work each day, enthusiasm for your work, a substantial share of good health, a couple of real friends and a wife and children to share life’s beauty with you.</string>
		<string>For me it is sufficient to have a corner by my hearth, a book and a friend, and a nap undisturbed by creditors or grief.</string>
		<string>You cannot judge what should bring others joy, and others cannot judge what should bring you joy.</string>
		<string>The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than growing with them.</string>
		<string>Be happy with what you have. Be excited about what you want.</string>
		<string>Our capacity to draw happiness from aesthetic objects or material goods in fact seems critically dependent on our first satisfying a more important range of emotional or psychological needs, among them the need for understanding, for love, expression and respect.</string>
		<string>If you start to think the problem is ‘out there,’ stop yourself. That thought is the problem.</string>
		<string>Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.</string>
		<string>Happiness is not a station you arrive at, but a manner of traveling.</string>
		<string>Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.</string>
		<string>Security is when everything is settled, when nothing can happen to you; security is the denial of life.</string>
		<string>Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.</string>
		<string>Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.</string>
		<string>The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, then there will be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be.</string>
		<string>In our lives, change is unavoidable, loss is unavoidable. In the adaptability and ease with which we experience change, lies our happiness and freedom.</string>
		<string>Live with intention. Walk to the edge. Listen hard. Practice wellness. Play with abandon. Laugh. Choose with no regret. Do what you love. Live as if this is all there is.</string>
		<string>You never regret being kind.</string>
		<string>They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.</string>
		<string>Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future.</string>
		<string>The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly.</string>
		<string>True happiness is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.</string>
		<string>Most of us miss out on life’s big prizes. The Pulitzer. The Nobel. Oscars. The World Cup. But we’re all eligible for life’s smaller prizes... A pat on the back. A kiss behind the    ear. A four-pound bass. A full moon. An empty parking space. A crackling fire. A great meal. A glorious sunset. Hot soup. Cold beer.</string>
		<string>Money is neither my god nor my devil. It is a form of energy that tends to make us more of who we already are, whether it’s greedy or loving.</string>
		<string>The need for forgiveness is an illusion. There is nothing to forgive.</string>
		<string>Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting.</string>
		<string>Reflect upon you present blessings, of which every man has many - not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some.</string>
		<string>Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.</string>
		<string>Much of the stress that people feel doesn’t come from having too much to do. It comes from not finishing what they’ve started.</string>
		<string>He who lives in harmony with himself lives in harmony with the universe.</string>
		<string>If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.</string>
		<string>All the world’s a stage, and the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts.</string>
		<string>Dream as if you’ll live forever, live as if you’ll die today.</string>
		<string>When one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us.</string>
		<string>Happiness is not having what you want. It is appreciating what you have.</string>
		<string>True happiness... arises, in the first place, from the enjoyment of one’s self.</string>
		<string>Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one’s values.</string>
		<string>All this world is but a play... be thou the joyful player.</string>
		<string>Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is beauty, admire it. Life is bliss, taste it. Life is a dream, realize it. Life is a challenge, meet it. Life is a duty, complete it. Life is a game, play it. Life is a promise, fulfill it. Life is sorrow, overcome it. Life is a song, sing it. Life is a struggle, accept it. Life is a tragedy, confront it. Life is an adventure, dare it. Life is luck, make it. Life is too precious, do not destroy it. Life is life, fight for it.</string>
		<string>Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.</string>
		<string>We can have peace if we let go of wanting to change the past and wanting to control the future.</string>
		<string>We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.</string>
		<string>Money doesn’t bring happiness and creativity. Your creativity and happiness brings money.</string>
		<string>Happiness is the experience of loving life. Being happy is being in love with that momentary experience. And love is looking at someone or even something and seeing the absolute best in him/her or it. Love is happiness with what you see. So love and happiness really are the same thing... just expressed differently.</string>
		<string>Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.</string>
		<string>God comforts the disturbed and disturbs the comfortable.</string>
		<string>Carefully watch your THOUGHTS, for they become your WORDS. Manage and watch your WORDS, for they will become your ACTIONS. Consider and judge your ACTIONS, for they have become your HABITS. Acknowledge and watch your HABITS, for they shall become your VALUES. Understand and embrace your VALUES, for they become YOUR DESTINY.</string>
		<string>Wisdom is knowing what path to take next... Integrity is taking it.</string>
		<string>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</string>
		<string>I am not bound to win, I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to the light I have.</string>
		<string>Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.</string>
		<string>We all get report cards in many different ways, but the real excitement of what you’re doing is in the doing of it. It’s not what you’re gonna get in the end - it’s not the final curtain - it’s really in the doing it, and loving what you’re doing.</string>
		<string>Happiness in life is not measured by the things we achieve, the places we go, or the route that we take to get there. Happiness in life is measured by the people that we share all of our experiences with.</string>
		<string>There is no stress in the world, only people thinking stressful thoughts and then acting on them.</string>
		<string>In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you.</string>
		<string>Everything is a gift of the universe - even joy, anger, jealously, frustration, or separateness. Everything is perfect either for our growth or our enjoyment.</string>
		<string>We fear that we are inadequate, but our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves: “Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?</string>
		<string>A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.</string>
		<string>There is only one thing more painful than learning from experience and that is not learning from experience.</string>
		<string>Once you do something you love, you never have to work again.</string>
		<string>Take time to work - it is the price of success Take time to think - it is the source of power Take time to play - it is the secret of perpetual youth Take time to read - it is the fountain of wisdom Take time to be friendly - it is the road to happiness Take time to love and be loved - it is the nourishment of the soul Take time to share - it is too short a life to be selfish Take time to laugh - it is the music of the heart Take time to dream - it is hitching your wagon to a star.</string>
		<string>Anything in life that we don’t accept will simply make trouble for us until we make peace with it.</string>
		<string>The right way is not always the popular and easy way. Standing for right when it is unpopular is a true test of moral character.</string>
		<string>Persons of high self-esteem are not driven to make themselves superior to others; they do not seek to prove their value by measuring themselves against a comparative standard. Their joy is being who they are, not in being better than someone else.</string>
		<string>Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.</string>
		<string>Do what you have always done and you’ll get what you have always got.</string>
		<string>The happiness of life is made up of the little charities of a kiss or smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment.</string>
		<string>We avoid the things that we’re afraid of because we think there will be dire consequences if we confront them. But the truly dire consequences in our lives come from avoiding things that we need to learn about or discover.</string>
		<string>If we become uncomfortable in any given moment, we can look at a flower, a pebble in the street or the tire on our car and be grateful. We can gaze at a person in the distance or at a cloud in the sky and be appreciative. We can smile at a stranger, hug someone we know or tidy a disorganized shelf and be thankful for the opportunity. If we choose gratitude, we will be happy!</string>
		<string>Life isn’t measured by the breaths you take, but by the moments that take your breath away.</string>
		<string>Think of what you have rather than of what you lack. Of the things you have, select the best and then reflect how eagerly you would have sought them if you did not have them.</string>
		<string>Happiness is where we find it, but very rarely where we seek it.</string>
		<string>To be content means that you realize you contain what you seek.</string>
		<string>Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday. Was it worth it?</string>
		<string>The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.</string>
		<string>Both abundance and lack exist simultaneously in our lives, as parallel realities. It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will tend...when we choose not to focus on what is missing from our lives but are grateful for the abundance that’s present—love, health, family, friends, work, the joys of nature and personal pursuits that bring us pleasure—the wasteland of illusion falls away and we experience Heaven on earth.</string>
		<string>The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself.</string>
		<string>God, grant me serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.</string>
		<string>That which does not kill you makes you stronger.</string>
		<string>Boredom is the feeling that everything is a waste of time; serenity, that nothing is.</string>
		<string>In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy.</string>
		<string>A man who does simply what is required of him will never know peace; for that, he must do all that he can.</string>
		<string>Look at everything as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time. Then your time on earth will be filled with glory.</string>
		<string>You are responsible for your life. You can’t keep blaming somebody else for your dysfunction. Life is really about moving on.</string>
		<string>Expecting life to treat you well because you are a good person is like expecting an angry bull not to charge because you are a vegetarian.</string>
		<string>View life as a series of movie frames, the ending and meaning may not be apparent until the very end of the movie, and yet, each of the hundreds of individual frames has meaning within the context of the whole movie.   “View your life from your funeral, looking back at your life experiences, what have you accomplished? what would you have wanted to accomplish but didn’t? what were the happy moments? what were the sad? what would you do again, and what you wouldn’t?</string>
		<string>You are up and you are happy. You are down and you are sad. All ups and downs help you to find a balance in your being. This is what life is all about. Once balanced, no more ups and downs, but bliss and joy and silence and gratitude.</string>
		<string>Yesterday is the past. Tomorrow is the future. Today is a gift and that’s why we call it the present.</string>
		<string>He who dares nothing need hope for nothing.</string>
		<string>Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs - even though checkered by failure - than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.</string>
		<string>A coward gets scared and quits. A hero gets scared, but still goes on.</string>
		<string>Communication is the solvent of all problems and is the foundation for personal development.</string>
		<string>A good listener is not only popular everywhere, but after a while he knows something.</string>
		<string>Nothing lowers the level of conversation more than raising the voice.</string>
		<string>What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they are joined... to strengthen each other... to be at one with each other in silent unspeakable memories.</string>
		<string>Love is like the truth, sometimes it prevails, and sometimes it hurts.</string>
		<string>To love leaves us open to loss. But we do it to ourselves because it is worth it.</string>
		<string>An open ear is the only believable sign of an open heart.</string>
		<string>At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet.</string>
		<string>People who do not understand you will never settle for any proof, and people who appreciate you do not need any proof. </string>
		<string>It is much easier to be critical than to be correct.</string>
		<string>Love can make a summer fly, or a night seem like a lifetime.</string>
		<string>Someone’s opinion of you does not have to become your reality.</string>
		<string>Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.</string>
		<string>What is most beautiful in virile men is something feminine; what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine.</string>
		<string>No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</string>
		<string>Have the courage to be sincere, clear and honest. This opens the door to deeper communication all around. It creates self-empowerment and the kind of connections with others we all want in life. Speaking from the heart frees us from the secrets that burden us. These secrets are what make us sick or fearful. Speaking truth helps you get clarity on your real heart directives.</string>
		<string>Abilities wither under faultfinding, blossom with encouragement.</string>
		<string>Oh the comfort, the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but pouring them all right out, just as they are - chaff and grain together - certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and with the breath of kindness blow the rest away.</string>
		<string>When you like someone, you like them in spite of their faults. When you love someone, you love them with their faults.</string>
		<string>People change and forget to tell each other.</string>
		<string>If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. And if they don’t, they never were</string>
		<string>Friendship with one’s self is all important, because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in the world.</string>
		<string>Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.</string>
		<string>Love and concern for all are not things some of us are born with and others are not. Rather, they are results of what we do with our minds: We can choose to transform our minds so that they embody love, or we can allow them to develop habits and false concepts of separation.</string>
		<string>Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something.</string>
		<string>Good friendships are fragile things and require as much care as any other fragile and precious thing.</string>
		<string>The result of our people-judgments is that we often throw away someone’s ideas because they are voiced by the wrong person or because we don’t agree with all of their ideas.</string>
		<string>A friend hears the song in my heart and sings it to me when my memory fails.</string>
		<string>The people who matter will recognize who you are.</string>
		<string>If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</string>
		<string>With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing.</string>
		<string>Love is touching souls.</string>
		<string>A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow.</string>
		<string>Criticism is something we can avoid easily —by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing.</string>
		<string>Real love takes work. You have to be willing to make the effort.</string>
		<string>There is harmony in the tension of opposites, as in the case of the bow and lyre.</string>
		<string>Life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.</string>
		<string>The happiness of life is made up of the little charities of a kiss or smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment.</string>
		<string>What most people need to learn in life is how to love people and use things instead of using people and loving things.</string>
		<string>The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to life that nothing else can bring.</string>
		<string>The wise stand out because they see themselves as part of the Whole. They shine because they don’t want to impress. They achieve great things because they don’t look for recognition. Their wisdom is contained in what they are, not their opinions. They refuse to argue, so no-one argues with them.</string>
		<string>The judgement of others does not change who I am. Quite the opposite is true. It reveals who they are.</string>
		<string>Speaking with kindness creates confidence, thinking with kindness creates profoundness, giving with kindness creates love.</string>
		<string>A friend is a person with whom I may be honest. Before him, I may think aloud.</string>
		<string>Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish.</string>
		<string>If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.</string>
		<string>A friend is someone who knows the song of your soul and sings it back to you when you’ve forgotten the words.</string>
		<string>The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing at the right time, but also to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.</string>
		<string>We would not have to forgive people if we didn’t judge them in the first place.</string>
		<string>Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, the other gold.</string>
		<string>To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.</string>
		<string>When someone’s character seems impossible to fathom, observe his friends.</string>
		<string>A true friend is someone who understands your past, believes in your future and accepts you today, just the way you are.</string>
		<string>The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to life that nothing else can bring.</string>
		<string>If someone does not smile at you, be generous and offer your own smile. Nobody needs a smile more than the one that cannot smile to others.</string>
		<string>If we don’t believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don’t believe in it at all.</string>
		<string>No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted.</string>
		<string>I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.</string>
		<string>The secret of attraction is to love yourself. Attractive people judge neither themselves nor others. They are open to gestures of love. They think about love, and express their love in every action. They know that love is not a mere sentiment, but the ultimate truth at the heart of the universe.</string>
		<string>Don’t rob a friend, a partner, family member or the world of someone that could have been a real companion, and someone that could make a difference. Don’t ever give up being special!</string>
		<string>That’s what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is. Most people love you for who you pretend to be. To keep their love, you keep pretending performing. You get to love your pretense. It’s true, we’re locked in an image, an act and the sad thing is, people get so used to their image, they grow attached to their masks. They love their chains. They forget all about who they really are. And if you try to remind them, they hate you for it, they feel like you’re trying to steal their most precious possession.</string>
		<string>In the midst of great joy, do not promise anyone anything. In the midst of great anger, do not answer anyone’s letter.</string>
		<string>Deal with the faults of others as gently as with your own.</string>
		<string>We would not have to forgive people if we didn’t judge them in the first place.</string>
		<string>Sentimentality - that’s what we call the sentiment we don’t share.</string>
		<string>Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distance continues to exist, a wonderful living side-by-side can grow up, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole and against a wide sky.</string>
		<string>Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.</string>
		<string>Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear.</string>
		<string>It is your decisions not your conditions that truly shape the quality of your life.</string>
		<string>Life is found in the dance between your deepest desire and your greatest fear.</string>
		<string>How do we keep our inner fire alive? Two things, at minimum, are needed: an ability to appreciate the positives in our life - and a commitment to action. Every day, it’s important to ask and answer these questions: ‘What’s good in my life?’ and ‘What needs to be done?’</string>
		<string>The price of excellence is discipline; the cost of mediocrity is disappointment.</string>
		<string>If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant; if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome.</string>
		<string>Sometimes our fate resembles a fruit tree in winter. Who would think that those branches would turn green again and blossom, but we hope it, we know it.</string>
		<string>Even if you encounter opposition, have conviction and finish what you start. In the end, people will understand.</string>
		<string>My grandfather once told me that there were two kinds of people: those who do the work and those who take the credit. He told me to try to be in the first group; there was much less competition.</string>
		<string>A moment of choice is a moment of truth. It’s the testing point of our character and competence.</string>
		<string>If your ship doesn’t come in, swim out to it!</string>
		<string>If doubt is challenging you and you do not act, doubts will GROW. Challenge the doubts with action and YOU will grow.</string>
		<string>Those who turn good organizations into great organizations are motivated by a deep creative urge and an inner compulsion for sheer unadulterated excellence for its own sake.</string>
		<string>Compromise: The art of dividing a cake in such a way that everybody believes he got the biggest piece.</string>
		<string>We cannot direct the wind but we can adjust the sails.</string>
		<string>Life’s not about waiting for the storms to pass... it’s about learning to dance in the rain.</string>
		<string>When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on.</string>
		<string>Power is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent than the one derived from fear of punishment.</string>
		<string>Keep your thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your words positive because your words become your behaviors. Keep your behaviors positive because your behaviors become your habits. Keep your habits positive because your habits become your values. Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny.</string>
		<string>A smooth sea never made a skilled mariner.</string>
		<string>Great masters merit emulation, not worship.</string>
		<string>Clear, written goals have a wonderful effect on your thinking. They motivate you and galvanize you into action. They stimulate your creativity, release your energy, and help you to overcome procrastination as much as any other factor.</string>
		<string>Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now.</string>
		<string>Confidence is contagious. So is the lack of confidence.</string>
		<string>Optimism may sometimes be delusional, but pessimism is always delusional.</string>
		<string>Few things help an individual more than to place responsibility upon them and to let them know that you trust them.</string>
		<string>We are continually faced with great opportunities which are brilliantly disguised as unsolvable problems.</string>
		<string>Long-range goals keep you from being frustrated by short-term failures.</string>
		<string>If you just set out to be liked, you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time, and you would achieve nothing.</string>
		<string>You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don’t try.</string>
		<string>We can do anything we want to as long as we stick to it long enough.</string>
		<string>In organizations, real power and energy is generated through relationships. The patterns of relationships and the capacities to form them are more important than tasks, functions, roles, and positions.</string>
		<string>It’s not differences that divide us. It’s our judgments about each other that do.</string>
		<string>You have within you right now, everything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you.</string>
		<string>There will come a time when you believe everything is finished. That will be the beginning.</string>
		<string>It is understanding that gives us an ability to have peace. When we understand the other fellow’s viewpoint, and he understands ours, then we can sit down and work out our differences.</string>
		<string>Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power.</string>
		<string>Freedom is actually a bigger game than power. Power is about what you can control. Freedom is about what you can unleash.</string>
		<string>Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.</string>
		<string>Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.</string>
		<string>Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.</string>
		<string>A leader is a dealer in hope.</string>
		<string>The very essence of leadership is that you have to have vision. You can’t blow an uncertain trumpet.</string>
		<string>The best executive is the one who has sense enough to pick good men to do what he wants done, and self-restraint to keep from meddling with them while they do it.</string>
		<string>A leader is one who sees more than others see, who sees farther than others see, and who sees before others see.</string>
		<string>The task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been.</string>
		<string>Great leaders are almost always great simplifiers, who can cut through argument, debate, and doubt to offer a solution everybody can understand.</string>
		<string>In periods where there is no leadership, society stands still. Progress occurs when courageous, skillful leaders seize the opportunity to change things for the better.</string>
		<string>The leader is one who mobilizes others toward a goal shared by leader and followers.</string>
		<string>Leadership is lifting a person’s vision to higher sights, the raising of a person’s performance to a higher standard, the building of a personality beyond its normal limitations.</string>
		<string>Leadership is getting people to work for you when they are not obligated.</string>
		<string>My own definition of leadership is this: The capacity and the will to rally men and women to a common purpose and the character which inspires confidence.</string>
		<string>I think leadership comes from integrity - that you do whatever you ask others to do. I think there are non-obvious ways to lead. Just by providing a good example as a parent, a friend, a neighbor makes it possible for other people to see better ways to do things. Leadership does not need to be a dramatic, fist in the air and trumpets blaring, activity.</string>
		<string>Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others.</string>
		<string>The leader has to be practical and a realist, yet must talk the language of the visionary and the idealist.</string>
		<string>Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power.</string>
		<string>Am I not destroying my enemies when I make friends of them?</string>
		<string>Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.</string>
		<string>Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain, and most fools do.</string>
		<string>Beware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a big ship.</string>
		<string>He that is of the opinion money will do everything may well be suspected of doing everything for money.</string>
		<string>First ask yourself: What is the worst that can happen? Then prepare to accept it. Then proceed to improve on the worst.</string>
		<string>If you want to gather honey, don’t kick over the beehive.</string>
		<string>You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.</string>
		<string>Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.</string>
		<string>An intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows.</string>
		<string>Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you’re a thousand miles from the corn field.</string>
		<string>To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.</string>
		<string>Few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder.</string>
		<string>If you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem. You may fool all of the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.</string>
		<string>Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.</string>
		<string>You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist.</string>
		<string>I can honestly say that I was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking. If I felt it was the right thing to do, I was for it regardless of the possible outcome.</string>
		<string>Failure is only the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.</string>
		<string>Associate yourself with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation, for ’tis better to be alone than in bad company.</string>
		<string>The price of greatness is responsibility.</string>
		<string>The greatest lesson in life is to know that even fools are right sometimes.</string>
		<string>It is a mistake to look too far ahead. Only one link in the chain of destiny can be handled at a time.</string>
		<string>If you want to get somewhere you have to know where you want to go and how to get there. Then never, never, never give up.</string>
		<string>We must find time to stop and thank the people who have made a difference in our lives.</string>
		<string>To lead people, walk beside them... As for the best leaders, the people do not notice their existence. The next best, the people honor and praise. The next, the people fear; and the next, the people hate. When the best leader’s work is done the people say, ‘We did it ourselves’.</string>
		<string>The consequence of living our lives at warp speed is that we rarely take time to reflect on what we value most deeply or to keep these priorities front and center. Most of us spend more time reacting to immediate crises and responding to expectations from others than we do making considered choices guided by what matters most to us.</string>
		<string>Conviction is worthless unless it is converted into conduct.</string>
		<string>Courage is doing what you are afraid to do. There can be no courage without fear.</string>
		<string>Entrepreneurship is a state of mind, a can-do attitude, a capacity to focus on a vision and work toward it.</string>
		<string>Many of our fears are tissue paper thin, and a single courageous step would carry us clear through them.</string>
		<string>Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood.</string>
		<string>If your actions inspire others to do more, to learn more, to dream more or to become more, you are a leader.</string>
		<string>When we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm, miracles can happen.</string>
		<string>It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan.</string>
		<string>The wise man bridges the gap by laying out the path by means of which he can get from where he is to where he wants to go.</string>
		<string>A smooth sea never made a skilled mariner.</string>
		<string>The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You will. The question is, are you ready to get back up... and fight for what you believe in?</string>
		<string>Out of clutter, find simplicity. From discord, find harmony. In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.</string>
		<string>You will never change your life until you change something you do daily.</string>
		<string>Real difficulties can be overcome. It’s the imaginary ones that are unconquerable.</string>
		<string>Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgement that something else is more important than fear.</string>
		<string>Luck favors the well prepared.</string>
		<string>Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.</string>
		<string>If we can only accept what we currently believe, we have already reached our full potential. Be willing to experiment, to take risks. While skepticism can be healthy, too much skepticism can be deadly... deadly to one’s spirit, to one’s sense of well-being and to one’s dreams.</string>
		<string>People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions and help them throw rocks at their enemies.</string>
		<string>Your past is not your potential. In any hour you can choose to liberate the future.</string>
		<string>The minute you settle for less than you deserve, you get even less than you settled for.</string>
		<string>Adversity is like a strong wind. It tears away from us all but the things that cannot be torn, so that we see ourselves as we really are.</string>
		<string>Real obstacles don’t take you in circles. They can be overcome. Invented ones are like a maze.</string>
		<string>If you do not change direction, you may end up where you’re heading.</string>
		<string>The cave you most fear to enter contains the greatest treasure.</string>
		<string>The tragedy of life is not found in failure but complacency. Not in you doing too much, but doing too little. Not in you living above your means, but below your capacity. It’s not failure but aiming too low, that is life’s greatest tragedy.</string>
		<string>I will try again tomorrow.</string>
		<string>Calm self-confidence is as far from conceit as the desire to earn a decent living is remote from greed.</string>
		<string>Class is an aura of confidence that is being sure without being cocky. Class has nothing to do with money. Class never runs scared. It is self-discipline and selfknowledge. It’s the sure footedness that comes with having proved you can meet life.</string>
		<string>Courage is the greatest of all the virtues. Because if you haven’t courage, you may not have an opportunity to use any of the others.</string>
		<string>Fear is the opportunity for courage, not proof of cowardice.</string>
		<string>Many of our fears are tissue paper thin, and a single courageous step would carry us clear through them.</string>
		<string>Ships are safe within the harbor, but is that what ships are for?</string>
		<string>Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment.</string>
		<string>One’s action ought to come out of an achieved stillness: not to be a mere rushing on.</string>
		<string>It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that things are difficult.</string>
		<string>While one person hesitates because he feels inferior, the other is busy making mistakes and becoming superior.</string>
		<string>You can’t help someone get up a hill without getting closer to the top yourself.</string>
		<string>Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.</string>
		<string>I don’t know if you’ll succeed or fail, but I know this: you will fail if you don’t try!</string>
		<string>Better to fail at doing the right thing than to succeed at doing the wrong thing.</string>
		<string>People rarely succeed unless they enjoy what they are doing.</string>
		<string>Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.</string>
		<string>Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, it’s unlikely you will step up and take responsibility for making it so. If you assume that there’s no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, there is a chance you may contribute to making a better world. The choice is yours.</string>
		<string>It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.</string>
		<string>Knowledge is learning something new every day. Wisdom is letting go of something every day.</string>
		<string>Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that a son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president of a nation.</string>
		<string>He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever.</string>
		<string>The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.</string>
		<string>An investment in knowledge pays the best dividends.</string>
		<string>There are obviously two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live.</string>
		<string>Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire.</string>
		<string>Curiosity is the very basis of education and if you tell me that curiosity killed the cat, I say only that the cat died nobly.</string>
		<string>Learning is not attained by chance. It must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence.</string>
		<string>Minds are like parachutes, they only function when they are open.</string>
		<string>The mind is like the stomach. It is not how much you put into it that counts, but how much it digests.</string>
		<string>The best thing parents can do for their children is to love each other.</string>
		<string>If he is indeed wise, the teacher does not bid you enter the house of wisdom, but rather he leads you to the threshold of your own mind.</string>
		<string>The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher regard those who think alike than those who think differently.</string>
		<string>Tell me and I’ll forget. Show me and I’ll remember. Involve me and I’ll understand.</string>
		<string>If you think that education is expensive, try ignorance.</string>
		<string>He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not remains a fools for life.</string>
		<string>Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.</string>
		<string>The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.</string>
		<string>A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.</string>
		<string>Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, and though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love, but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.    You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward, nor tarries with yesterday.</string>
		<string>When inquiry is suppressed by previous knowledge, or by the authority and experience of another, then learning becomes mere imitation, and imitation causes a human being to repeat what is learned without experiencing it.</string>
		<string>Children need models rather than critics.</string>
		<string>It is what we think we know already that often prevents us from learning.</string>
		<string>The way to make learning a lesson a celebration, instead of a cause for regret, is to ask ... How can I put this to use today?</string>
		<string>If someone feels that he has never made a mistake in his life, it only means that he has never tried anything new in his life.</string>
		<string>Learning without thinking is labor lost; thinking without learning is perilous.</string>
		<string>Prejudice is the child of ignorance.</string>
		<string>The young do not know enough to be prudent, and therefore they attempt the impossible, and achieve it, generation after generation.</string>
		<string>The only stupid question is one not asked.</string>
		<string>We have not passed that subtle line between childhood and adulthood until we have stopped saying ‘It got lost,’ and say, ‘I lost it.’ </string>
		<string>Education is nothing more, nor less, than learning to think!</string>
		<string>An educated mind is useless without a focussed will and dangerous without a loving heart.</string>
		<string>In their freedom, birds make expanding circles in the sky. How do they learn to be free? They fall—and by falling are given wings to fly.</string>
		<string>The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.</string>
		<string>The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.</string>
		<string>Our vision is more obstructed by what we think we know than by our lack of knowledge.</string>
		<string>Every act of conscious learning requires the willingness to suffer injury to our selfesteem. That is why young children, before they are aware of their self-importance, learn so easily; and why older people, especially if vain or arrogant, cannot learn at all.</string>
		<string>The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more often likely to be foolish than sensible...</string>
		<string>It takes more courage to alter an opinion than to stick with it.</string>
		<string>Comfort is found among those who agree with you; growth among those who don’t.</string>
		<string>The fact that someone says something doesn’t mean it’s true. Doesn’t mean they’re lying, but it doesn’t mean it’s true.</string>
		<string>As human beings we all want to be happy and free from misery... we have learned that the key to happiness is inner peace. The greatest obstacles to inner peace are disturbing emotions such as anger, attachment, fear and suspicion, while love and compassion and a sense of universal responsibility are the sources of peace and happiness.</string>
		<string>Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.</string>
		<string>Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.</string>
		<string>He who smiles rather than rages is always the stronger.</string>
		<string>Maturity is achieved when a person postpones immediate pleasures for long-term values.</string>
		<string>Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident. Riches take wing. Only one thing endures. And that is character.</string>
		<string>When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.</string>
		<string>There’s enough for everyone’s need, but not for everyone’s greed.</string>
		<string>Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else: you are the one who gets burned.</string>
		<string>Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future.</string>
		<string>Jealousy sees things always with magnifying glasses which make little things large, of dwarfs giants, of suspicions truths.</string>
		<string>Never react emotionally to criticism. Analyze yourself to determine whether it is justified. If it is, correct yourself. Otherwise, go on about your business.</string>
		<string>We cannot tell what may happen to us in the strange medley of life. But we can decide what happens in us —how we can take it, what we do with it —and that is what really counts in the end.</string>
		<string>We plant seeds that will flower as results in our lives, so best to remove the weeds of anger, avarice, envy and doubt...</string>
		<string>Any person capable of angering you becomes your master.</string>
		<string>Because fear is insatiable, everything that is insatiable is born of fear.</string>
		<string>There are two cardinal sins from which all the others spring: impatience and laziness.</string>
		<string>Love the heart that hurts you, but never hurt the heart that loves you.</string>
		<string>Our feelings are our most genuine paths to knowledge.</string>
		<string>Instead of resisting any emotion, the best way to dispel it is to enter it fully, embrace it and see through your resistance.</string>
		<string>We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.</string>
		<string>You can conquer almost any fear if you will only make up your mind to do so. For remember, fear doesn’t exist anywhere except in the mind.</string>
		<string>Transformation occurs when existing solutions, assumed truths and past decisions are exposed as unrealistic and self-defeating.</string>
		<string>Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything wise in this world.</string>
		<string>Experience is not what happens to you - it’s how you interpret what happens to you.</string>
		<string>With fear, possessiveness enters the picture, then jealousy rears its ugly head. Jealousy is the opposite of desiring life and freedom of choice for one’s partner.</string>
		<string>Never speak out of anger, Never act out of fear, Never choose from impatience, But wait... and peace will appear.</string>
		<string>Better keep yourself clean and bright; you are the window through which you must see the world.</string>
		<string>Confidence on the outside begins by living with integrity on the inside.</string>
		<string>Faith is a journey...not a guilt trip.</string>
		<string>The best portion of a good man’s life is the little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love.</string>
		<string>In every person who comes near you look for what is good and strong; honor that; try to imitate it, and your faults will drop off like dead leaves when their time comes.</string>
		<string>Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.</string>
		<string>Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver.</string>
		<string>Humility is born of the spirit, humiliation of the ego.</string>
		<string>The sign of intelligent people is their ability to control emotions by the application of reason.</string>
		<string>The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to life that nothing else can bring.</string>
		<string>We plant seeds that will flower as results in our lives, so best to remove the weeds of anger, avarice, envy and doubt...</string>
		<string>Use pain as a stepping stone, not a camp ground.</string>
		<string>When you make people angry, they act in accordance with their baser instincts, often violently and irrationally. When you inspire people, they act in accordance with their higher instincts, sensibly and rationally. Also, anger is transient, whereas inspiration sometimes has a life-long effect.</string>
		<string>Persons of high self-esteem are not driven to make themselves superior to others; they do not seek to prove their value by measuring themselves against a comparative standard. Their joy is being who they are, not in being better than someone else.</string>
		<string>Those who enter the gates of heaven are not beings who have no passions or who have curbed the passions, but those who have cultivated an understanding of them.</string>
		<string>Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.</string>
		<string>If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we would find in each man’s life a sorrow and a suffering enough to disarm all hostility.</string>
		<string>Change has a considerable psychological impact on the human mind. To the fearful it is threatening because it means that things may get worse. To the hopeful it is encouraging because things may bet better. To the confident it is inspiring because the challenge now exists to make things better.</string>
		<string>The sign of intelligent people is their ability to control emotions by the application of reason.</string>
		<string>He who fears he will suffer, already suffers from his fear.</string>
		<string>For it is not death or hardship that is a fearful thing, but the fear of death or hardship.</string>
		<string>Whatever is begun in anger, ends in shame.</string>
		<string>Our identity is very closely associated with our thoughts and feelings. Usually, when we feel anger, we become angry. We are anger itself. When we feel depressed, we are    depression. When we feel greedy we are greed. It’s easy to see ourselves in the emotional ‘guise du jour’ and mistake this costume for who we really are beneath it.</string>
		<string>Quick to judge, quick to anger, slow to understand... prejudice, fear and ignorance walk hand-in-hand.</string>
		<string>Deal with the faults of others as gently as with your own.</string>
		<string>Every time we allow someone to move us with anger, we teach them to be angry.</string>
		<string>Depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.</string>
		<string>No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</string>
		<string>He who spends time regretting the past loses the present and risks the future.</string>
		<string>Realize that now, in this moment of time, you are creating. You are creating your next moment based on what you are feeling and thinking. That is what’s real.</string>
		<string>Worrying is like being in a rocking chair. It gives you something to do but does not get you anywhere.</string>
		<string>When we have inner peace, we can be at peace with those around us. When our community is in a state of peace, it can share that peace with neighboring communities.</string>
		<string>How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment to improve the world.</string>
		<string>The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.</string>
		<string>In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing. The worst thing you can do is nothing.</string>
		<string>Until he extends his circle of compassion to include all living things, man will not himself find peace.</string>
		<string>I’m okay, you’re okay. Now let’s go to work.</string>
		<string>Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.</string>
		<string>Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another.</string>
		<string>All historical experience demonstrates the following: Our earth cannot be changed unless in the not too distant future an alteration in the consciousness of individuals is achieved.</string>
		<string>A radical inner transformation and rise to a new level of consciousness might be the only real hope we have in the current global crisis brought on by the dominance of the Western mechanistic paradigm.</string>
		<string>Let everyone sweep in front of his own door, and the whole world will be clean.</string>
		<string>Formal education will make you a living; self education will make you a fortune.</string>
		<string>Open your arms to change, but don’t let go of your values.</string>
		<string>You must take personal responsibility. You cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself.</string>
		<string>I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn’t learn something from him.</string>
		<string>Home is not where you live, but where they understand you.</string>
		<string>Man’s greatest actions are performed in minor struggles. Life, misfortune, isolation, abandonment and poverty are battlefields which have their heroes - obscure heroes who are at times greater than illustrious heroes.</string>
		<string>No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.</string>
		<string>It is your prime responsibility to acquire useful knowledge from others and to apply it appropriately. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel, but you do have to learn from those who did.</string>
		<string>It is more important to know where you are going than to get there quickly.</string>
		<string>Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind.</string>
		<string>It is good to dream, but it is better to dream and work. Faith is mighty, but action with faith is mightier.</string>
		<string>Patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it.</string>
		<string>Now is the moment. Act in harmony with your values, no matter what or whom you face. When you do, you will live with integrity and feel free and at peace.</string>
		<string>Never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what’s right.</string>
		<string>The past cannot be changed. The future is yet in your power.</string>
		<string>Little evil would be done in the world if evil never could be done in the name of good.</string>
		<string>The young do not know enough to be prudent, and therefore they attempt the impossible -- and achieve it, generation after generation.</string>
		<string>Virtue means doing the right thing, in relation to the right person, at the right time, to the right extent, in the right manner, and for the right purpose. Thus, to give money away is quite a simple task, but for the act to be virtuous, the donor must give to the right person, for the right purpose, in the right amount, in the right manner, and at the right time.</string>
		<string>Unswerving loyalty to duty, constant devotion to truth, and a clear conscience will overcome every discouragement and surely lead the way to usefulness and high achievement.</string>
		<string>Strange is our situation here upon earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know - that man is here for the sake of other men.</string>
		<string>I believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruits of his labor, so far as it in no way interferes with any other man’s rights.</string>
		<string>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.</string>
		<string>A lie has speed, but truth has endurance.</string>
		<string>An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.</string>
		<string>Who among us is not at a loss for words? Tears pour out. Tears of joy. Tears of relief. A stunning, whopping landslide of hope in a time of deep despair. In a nation that was founded on genocide and then built on the backs of slaves, it was an unexpected moment, shocking in its simplicity: Barack Obama, a good man, a black man, said he would bring change to Washington, and the majority of the country liked that idea.</string>
		<string>On account of being a democracy and run by the people, we are the only nation in the world that has to keep a government four years, no matter what it does.</string>
		<string>It is nobler to lose honor and save the lives of men than it is to gain honor by taking them.</string>
		<string>How very important it is to bring about in the human mind the radical revolution. The crisis is a crisis in consciousness, a crisis that cannot anymore accept the old norms, the old patterns, the ancient traditions. Considering what the world is now with all the misery, conflict, destructive brutality, aggression and so on... man is still as he was, is still brutal, violent, aggressive, acquisitive, competitive and has built a society along these lines.</string>
		<string>When freedom prevails, the ingenuity and inventiveness of people creates incredible wealth. This is the source of the natural improvement of the human condition.</string>
		<string>If you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything.</string>
		<string>The measure of a man cannot be whether he ever makes mistakes, because he will make mistakes. It’s what he does in response to his mistakes. The same is true of companies. We have to apologize, we have to fix the problem, and we have to learn from our mistakes.</string>
		<string>Start by doing what’s necessary, then do what’s possible, and suddenly... you are doing the impossible.</string>
		<string>To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.</string>
		<string>Whenever you find you are on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.</string>
		<string>The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don’t do anything about it.</string>
		<string>None of us can do great things. We can only do a small thing with great love every day!</string>
		<string>If you really want to create peace on the earth, create peace in your heart, in your being. That is the right place to begin with... and then spread and radiate peace and love.</string>
		<string>When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?</string>
		<string>Half of your power lies in your sameness with others. The other half lies in your uniqueness.</string>
		<string>We’ve been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope.</string>
		<string>We have to do the best we can. This is our sacred human responsibility.</string>
		<string>Freedom is actually a bigger game than power. Power is about what you can control. Freedom is about what you can unleash.</string>
		<string>No one knows what is in him till he tries, and many would never try if they were not forced to.</string>
		<string>In the new enlightenment, the reason we are driven to become one with the lifeprocess is not merely to experience some form of mystical oneness with everything. We strive to become one with it for the biggest reason there could be - so we can ultimately take responsibility for where it’s going.</string>
		<string>It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.</string>
		<string>The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You will. The question is, are you ready to get back up... and fight for what you believe in?</string>
		<string>In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.</string>
		<string>Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of Love; and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.</string>
		<string>In every community there is work to be done. In every nation, there are wounds to heal. In every heart there is the power to do it.</string>
		<string>This planet can be made a happier, more peaceful place to live, but the change will have to come from within the hearts of all of us living here.</string>
		<string>Re-examine all you have been told in school or church or in any book and dismiss whatever insults your own soul.</string>
		<string>If you’re not tough it’s hard to survive in this world; and if you’re not kind then you don’t deserve to survive.</string>
		<string>It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities.</string>
		<string>Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.</string>
		<string>The judgment of others does not change who I am. Quite the opposite is true. It reveals who they are.</string>
		<string>The right way is not always the popular and easy way. Standing for right when it is unpopular is a true test of moral character.</string>
		<string>You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time.</string>
		<string>The man who is aware of himself is henceforward independent; and he is never bored, and life is only too short, and he is steeped through and through with a profound yet temperate happiness. He alone lives, while other people, slaves of ceremony, let life slip past them in a kind of dream.</string>
		<string>It is not the strongest of the species who survive, not the most intelligent, but those who are the most adaptive to change.</string>
		<string>The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher regard those who think alike than those who think differently.</string>
		<string>A truth’s initial commotion is directly proportional to how deeply the lie was believed... When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker, a raving lunatic.</string>
		<string>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</string>
		<string>Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power.</string>
		<string>If there is righteousness in the heart There will be beauty in the character; If there is beauty in the character There will be harmony in the home; When there is harmony in the home There will be order in the nation; When there is order in the nation There will be peace in the world.</string>
		<string>If we don’t believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don’t believe in it at all.</string>
		<string>You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.</string>
		<string>So many gods, so many creeds, So many paths that cross and wind, While just the art of being kind Is all the sad world needs.</string>
		<string>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</string>
		<string>When I despair, I remember that all through history, the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time they seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it, always.</string>
		<string>A lie can go halfway around the world before the truth even gets its boots on.</string>
		<string>It’s easier to fight for one’s principles than to live up to them.</string>
		<string>The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.</string>
		<string>When we are no longer able to change a situation... we are challenged to change ourselves.</string>
		<string>Those who do not forgive history are assigned to repeat it until compassion replaces judgment.</string>
		<string>The right way is not always the popular and easy way. Standing for right when it is unpopular is a true test of moral character.</string>
		<string>History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely only after they have exhausted all other alternatives.</string>
		<string>A nation that values it’s privileges above its principles soon loses both.</string>
		<string>Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish.</string>
		<string>Opinions founded on prejudice are always defended with the greatest violence.</string>
		<string>What luck for the rulers that men do not think.</string>
		<string>The great mass of people more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a minor one.</string>
		<string>You can discover what your enemy fears most by what he uses to frighten you.</string>
		<string>Those who make peaceful reform impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.</string>
		<string>Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.</string>
		<string>If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.</string>
		<string>If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we would find in each man’s life a sorrow and a suffering enough to disarm all hostility.</string>
		<string>If war is ever lawful, then peace is sometimes sinful.</string>
		<string>Diplomacy is the art of letting someone else get your way.</string>
		<string>It is not the function of government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error.</string>
		<string>When you look at the long history of man, you see that more hideous crimes have been comitted in the name of obedience than have been comitted in the name of rebellion.</string>
		<string>Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.</string>
		<string>Whenever you find you are on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.</string>
		<string>If you are seeking revenge, start by digging two graves.</string>
		<string>Do you know what astonished me most in the world? The inability of force to create anything. In the long run, the sword is always beaten by the spirit.</string>
		<string>A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.</string>
		<string>The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don’t do anything about it.</string>
		<string>We all judge others, but we all hate it when others judge us.</string>
		<string>The measure of a person’s real character is what he would do if he knew he would never be found out.</string>
		<string>Everyone needs to be loved, especially when they do not deserve it.</string>
		<string>I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn’t learn something from him.</string>
		<string>People take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness. Just because they’re not on your road doesn’t mean they’ve gotten lost.</string>
		<string>If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.</string>
		<string>The art of progress is to preserve order amid change - and to preserve change amid order</string>
		<string>Don’t walk behind me; I may not lead. Don’t walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.</string>
		<string>He who trims himself to suit everyone will soon whittle himself away.</string>
		<string>I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming.</string>
		<string>You can stand tall without standing on someone. You can be a victor without having victims.</string>
		<string>An eye for an eye will only serve to make the whole world blind.</string>
		<string>Common sense, to most people, is nothing more than their own opinions.</string>
		<string>Just because you are not interested in politics, does not mean that politics is not interested in you.</string>
		<string>Once the game is over, the king and the pawn go back in the same box.</string>
		<string>Everything can be taken from a man but...the last of the human freedoms - to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.</string>
		<string>A human being is part of a whole, called by us the Universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.</string>
		<string>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</string>
		<string>If we don’t believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don’t believe in it at all.</string>
		<string>All that is necessary for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.</string>
		<string>Real peace is not the absence of conflict, it is the presence of justice</string>
		<string>A man is ethical only when life, as such, is sacred to him, that of plants and animals as that of his fellow men, and when he devotes himself helpfully to all life that is in need of help.</string>
		<string>Feeling grateful or appreciative of someone or something in your life actually attracts more of the things that you appreciate and value into your life.</string>
		<string>Civilization is a stream with banks. The stream is sometimes filled with blood from people killing, stealing, shouting and doing the things historians usually record, while on the banks, unnoticed, people build homes, make love, raise children, sing songs, write poetry and even whittle statues. The story of civilization is what happened on the banks.</string>
		<string>This above all: to thine own self be true. And it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.</string>
		<string>All mankind is divided into three classes: those who are immovable, those who are movable; and those who move.</string>
		<string>Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.</string>
		<string>Creativity reduces instinctual tension, it fuses pleasure with reality, and satisfies the libido.</string>
		<string>You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.</string>
		<string>An idea, like a ghost, must be spoken to a little before it will explain itself.</string>
		<string>If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.</string>
		<string>The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.</string>
		<string>You get told that the world is the way it is, but life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact; and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people no smarter than you. Once you learn that, youll never be the same again.</string>
		<string>The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and have forgotten the gift.</string>
		<string>Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.</string>
		<string>The conventional view serves to protect us from the painful job of thinking.</string>
		<string>The intuitive mind is a sacred gift; the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift.</string>
		<string>Change cannot be avoided... change provides the opportunity for innovation. It gives you the chance to demonstrate your creativity.</string>
		<string>Adversity has the effect of eliciting talents which, in prosperous circumstances, would have lain dormant.</string>
		<string>Vision without execution is hallucination.</string>
		<string>There are three kinds of people: 1. Innovators. 2. Imitators. 3. Idiots.</string>
		<string>Some people say that dreaming gets you nowhere in life. But I say you can’t get anywhere in life without dreaming.</string>
		<string>It is through science that we prove, but through intuition that we discover.</string>
		<string>The future is not some place we are going, but one we are creating. The paths are not to be found, but made. And the activity of making them changes both the maker and their destination.</string>
		<string>Change. It has the power to uplift, to heal, to stimulate, surprise, open new doors, bring fresh experience and create excitement in life. Certainly it is worth the risk.</string>
		<string>The beginning of wisdom is found in doubting; by doubting we come to the question.</string>
		<string>Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.</string>
		<string>Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.</string>
		<string>Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.</string>
		<string>The thoughts we choose to think are the tools we use to paint the canvas of our lives.</string>
		<string>Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.</string>
		<string>Reason can answer questions, but imagination has to ask them.</string>
		<string>If we would have new knowledge, we must get a whole world of new questions.</string>
		<string>Some men see things as they are and ask why. Others dream things that never were and ask why not.</string>
		<string>Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into his pictures.</string>
		<string>To know that we know what we know, and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.</string>
		<string>A true knowledge of ourselves is knowledge of our power.</string>
		<string>To assume is to be deceived.</string>
		<string>High values offer broad vision. Broad vision gives rise to burning desire. Burning desire leads to focused intent. Focused intent stimulates committed action. Then God arranges the details!</string>
		<string>Creativity is a marrying of our values, which determine the field of our endeavor, with our intentions, which draw to us the people, resources and finance. Creative genius values love and service and intends whatever is most urgently required.</string>
		<string>Creativity gives rise to the limited out of the unlimited, to sanity out of madness, to the valuable out of the priceless, to abundance out of nothingness, to the original out of the familiar and to hope out of despair.</string>
		<string>To create an original work you must become a seer with eyes of spirit, that penetrate an invisible world and see the unformed future, which is the potential birthing place of an innovative product, service, invention or artistic achievement. Then you need to go into labour!</string>
		<string>To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong.</string>
		<string>If you gave your inner genius as much credence as your inner critic, you would be light years ahead of where you now stand.</string>
		<string>Feeling and longing are the motive forces behind all human endeavor and human creations.</string>
		<string>Mastery is not perfection, it is journey, and the true master must be willing to try and fail and try again.</string>
		<string>To be independent of public opinion is the first formal condition of achieving anything great.</string>
		<string>The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers.</string>
		<string>Better to write for yourself and have no public, than to write for the public and have no self.</string>
		<string>It is our duty as men and women to proceed as though the limits to our abilities do not exist.</string>
		<string>The man who comes up with a means for doing or producing anything better, faster or more economically has his future and his fortune at his fingertips.</string>
		<string>The difference between great people and everyone else is that great people create their lives actively, while everyone else is created by their lives, passively waiting to see where life takes them next. The difference between the two is the difference between living fully and just existing.</string>
		<string>If you can imagine it, you can achieve it. If you can dream it, you can become it.</string>
		<string>Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation.</string>
		<string>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.</string>
		<string>When freedom prevails, the ingenuity and inventiveness of people creates incredible wealth. This is the source of the natural improvement of the human condition.</string>
		<string>Let go of your attachment to being right, and suddenly your mind is more open. You’re able to benefit from the unique viewpoints of others, without being crippled by your own judgment.</string>
		<string>To try is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest hazard of life is to risk nothing. The person who risks nothing does nothing, has nothing, is nothing. He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply cannot learn, feel, change, grow, live, and love.</string>
		<string>To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong.</string>
		<string>When I take on a new problem, I’m not interested in how it’s been done before. I only want to know, of all the constraints people tend to assume, which ones are actually fundamental and which ones are just habit?</string>
		<string>It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power.</string>
		<string>You can never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.</string>
		<string>If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.</string>
		<string>Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see.</string>
		<string>Different is not necessarily better but better is always different.</string>
		<string>Imagination is everything; it is the preview of life’s forthcoming attractions.</string>
		<string>Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you desire, you will what you imagine and at last you create what you will.</string>
		<string>Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams, who looks inside awakes.</string>
		<string>No great artists ever sees things as they really are. If he did then he would cease to be an artist.</string>
		<string>Perhaps the only limits to the human mind are those we believe in.</string>
		<string>The best way to predict the future is to invent it... </string>
		<string>Creativity is inventing, experimenting, growing, taking risks, breaking rules, making mistakes, and having fun.</string>
		<string>I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.</string>
		<string>You can’t depend on your judgement when your imagination is out of focus.</string>
		<string>The aspects of a thing that are most important to us are hidden to us because of their simplicity and familiarity.</string>
		<string>The man who strikes first admits that his ideas have run out.</string>
		<string>Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.</string>
		<string>You are the masterpiece of your own life; you are the Michelangelo of your own life. The David that you are sculpting is you.</string>
		<string>Don’t be afraid of the space between your dreams and reality. If you can dream it, you can make it so.</string>
		<string>Life is creation -- self and circumstances, the raw material.</string>
		<string>Life in itself is an empty canvas; it becomes whatsoever you paint on it. You can paint misery, you can paint bliss. This freedom is your glory.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>God gives talent, work transforms talent into genius.</string>
		<string>Change cannot be avoided... change provides the opportunity for innovation. It gives you the chance to demonstrate your creativity.</string>
		<string>Going against the grain may result in a few splinters, and it may rub a few people the wrong way, but going with it is like forcing your TRUE self to walk the plank!</string>
		<string>When solving problems, dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves.</string>
		<string>A dream is a wish your heart makes.</string>
		<string>We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers. Intellectual brilliance is no guarantee against being dead wrong.</string>
		<string>If I have ever made any valuable discoveries, it has been owing more to patient attention than to any other talent.</string>
		<string>Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.</string>
		<string>It often takes more courage to change one’s opinion than to keep it.</string>
		<string>Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith.</string>
		<string>The problem is not that there are problems. The problem is expecting otherwise and thinking that having problems is a problem.</string>
		<string>Imagination grows by exercise, and contrary to common belief, is more powerful in the mature than in the young.</string>
		<string>The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant.</string>
		<string>In each of us are places where we have never gone. Only by pressing the limits do we ever find them.</string>
		<string>Life’s gift to you is your unique vantage point. Your gift to life is expressing from it.</string>
		<string>A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself. What a man can be, he must be.</string>
		<string>The deepest longing in the human breast is the desire for appreciation.</string>
		<string>Intuition is not contrary to reason, but outside the province of reason.</string>
		<string>The road to enlightenment is paved with authenticity, not imitation.</string>
		<string>Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, it’s unlikely you will step up and take responsibility for making it    so. If you assume that there’s no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, there is a chance you may contribute to making a better world. The choice is yours.</string>
		<string>It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.</string>
		<string>When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bounds. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive, and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamed yourself to be.</string>
		<string>If you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable, you disconnect yourself from what you truly want, and all that remains is a compromise.</string>
		<string>Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.</string>
		<string>I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.</string>
		<string>If you’re not living on the edge... you’re taking up too much room.</string>
		<string>Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.</string>
		<string>If life doesn’t offer a game worth playing, then invent a new one.</string>
		<string>It is through science that we prove, but through intuition that we discover.</string>
		<string>Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.</string>
		<string>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</string>
		<string>Vision without action is a daydream; action without vision is a nightmare.</string>
		<string>The impossible is often the untried.</string>
		<string>When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.</string>
		<string>Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them.</string>
		<string>When everything’s coming your way, you’re in the wrong lane.</string>
		<string>If it’s stupid but it works, it isn’t stupid.</string>
		<string>It takes more courage to alter an opinion than to stick with it.</string>
		<string>Comfort is found among those who agree with you; growth among those who don’t.</string>
		<string>Pay no attention to critics. No one ever erected a statue to a critic</string>
		<string>Everything looks impossible for the people who never try anything.</string>
		<string>When you’re young, you look at most of the programs on television and think, ‘There’s a conspiracy! The networks have conspired to dumb us down!’ But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in the business to make money by giving people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic. You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution!</string>
		<string>Without death there would be very little progress.</string>
		<string>You know, we don’t grow most of the food we eat. We wear clothes other people make. We speak a language that other people developed. We use a mathematics that other people evolved...

		<string>We don’t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we’ve chosen to do with our life. We could be sitting in a monastery somewhere in Japan. We could be out sailing. Some of the team could be playing golf.

		<string>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.

		<string>I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.</string>
		<string>I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people, and I can assure you that data processing is a fad that won’t last out the year.</string>
		<string>But what ... is it good for?</string>

		<string>This ‘telephone’ has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.</string>

		<string>We don’t like their sound, and guitar music is on the way out.</string>

		<string>So we went to Atari and said, ‘Hey, we’ve got this amazing thing, even built with some of your parts, and what do you think about funding us? Or we’ll give it to you. We just want to do it.

		<string>When one is at home, he dreams of adventure. When one is on an adventure, he dreams of home.</string>
		<string>True humor is fun - it does not put down, kid, or mock. It makes people feel wonderful, not separate, different, and cut off. True humor has beneath it the understanding that we are all in this together.</string>
		<string>Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I’m not sure about the universe.</string>
		<string>I prefer to be a pessimist; it makes it easier to deal with my inevitable failure.</string>
